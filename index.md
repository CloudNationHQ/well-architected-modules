## Value Proposition

Well-Architected Modules (WAM) is an initiative to establish and standardize best practices for Infrastructure-as-Code (IaC) modules. These modules adhere to defined standards, ensuring quality and consistency across Terraform implementations. Once aligned, they are classified as WAMs and made available through their respective registries.

WAM serves as a unified code base and toolkit for Customers, Partners, and CloudNation. It is a community-driven effort, fostering collaboration both within and outside CloudNation.

By codifying Microsoft’s Well-Architected Framework (WAF) and incorporating best practices, WAM accelerates the development and delivery of cloud-native or migrated applications and their supporting infrastructure.

## Modules

WAM provides two types of modules: **Resource Modules** and **Pattern Modules**.

These modules are designed to deploy Azure resources, their extensions, and reusable architectural patterns consistently. They act as composable building blocks that encapsulate groups of resources dedicated to specific tasks.

### Key Features:
- Flexible, generalized, and multi-purpose
- Integrates child and extension resources
- Enhances code quality and ensures a unified user experience

WAM simplifies the development process, enabling teams to deliver robust solutions efficiently.

{% include note.html content="WAM is owned, developed, and supported by CloudNation. For support or feature requests, you can raise a GitHub issue on this repository or the module’s repository directly.

Alternatively, you can log a support ticket, which will be redirected to the WAM team and the module owner(s).
